				<h4><em>Charles Altamont Doyle (British, 1832–1893), The Harvest Home, undated. Pen and watercolor over pencil. Gift of Princess Nina Mdivani Conan Doyle with assistance from The Friends.

				<h5>A line of handsome fairy couples dance gaily through sheaths of harvested wheat. Two fairies and their canine companion nestle comfortably beneath an abundance of fuchsia flowers. A brilliantly white ermine with a host of royal elfin riders look ready to leap from the page. All of these fairyland masterpieces (and more) are waiting to enchant you in The Huntington's latest works on paper exhibition, "The Unseen World of Charles Altamont Doyle," currently on view in the Huntington Gallery Works on Paper Room. These imaginative scenes may seem to capture only the nonsensical antics of fairy folk, but if you look closely, there is in fact a method to the madness.

				<p><h5>A video work by acclaimed Los Angeles artist Carolina Caycedo that reconceptualizes several iconic Huntington spaces through Afro-Latinx and indigenous spiritual practices and dance will go on view Aug. 17, 2019, through Feb. 10, 2020, in the historic Huntington Art Gallery, the Huntingtons' former residence, which is one of the settings in the piece. This month, with the support of the The Philip and Muriel Berman Foundation, The Huntington purchased the video jointly with VPAM, where it is currently on view.

				<h5>A new arrangement in the Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art features a Brillo Box by Andy Warhol and furniture by Frank Lloyd Wright and Donald Judd. All three artists used the rectangle to achieve stripped-down, straightforward works that, when placed side-by-side, reveal how complex, personal, and historically contingent “simplicity” can be. In the background are Ed Ruscha’s Radio (1964) and Kenneth Noland’s Par Transit (1964). Photo by Deborah Miller.</h5>

				<h4><em>Shigehisa Kuriyama, professor of cultural history at Harvard University, discusses the Inshoku yōjō kagami (Rules of Dietary Life), a Japanese woodblock print produced around 1850. The image appears to whimsically depict the traditional East Asian view of the body, but it in fact reflects the transformative impact of Western medicine and the rise of the money economy.</em></h4>

				<h5>At a time when humanities programs are under intense scrutiny and being slashed from college and university budgets, The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens and Caltech announced today the launch of a new research institute focused specifically on the history of science and technology. Positioned to become the preeminent institute of its kind in the western United States, the Caltech-Huntington Advanced Research Institute in the History of Science and Technology will extend collaborative historical research between a premier science and engineering university and a premier research library with extraordinary holdings in the history of science and technology.</h5>
